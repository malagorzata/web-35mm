        There are a number of different types of film cameras. Depending on what
        kind of photos you want to take or the setting where you will be taking
        pictures, some are better for some things than others. Here is a guide
        to help you getting a better idea what each camera is best for.

          <h3>Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) Cameras</h3>
          <p>
            These cameras are the analog equivalent of the DSLR. It has the same
            internal mirror mechanism that allows you to look straight through
            the lens and see a near-exact approximation of what the image will
            look like once it’s captured. SLR cameras also allow you to swap
            lenses, enabling you to exert greater control over your shots.

          <h3>Twin-Lens Reflex (TLR) Cameras</h3>
          <p>
            Equipped with double objective lenses of identical focal lengths,
            twin-lens reflex or TLR cameras are able to continuously display the
            scene you are trying to shoot on the viewfinder screen—they do not
            “black out” during exposure like SLRs do. One lens is used for
            viewing while the other lens exposes the film, and thanks to these
            separate lenses, you can examine the scene as the camera takes the
            shot, which can be helpful for certain applications that require
            longer shutter speeds.

          <h3>Rangefinder Cameras</h3>
          <p>
            The most distinguishing feature of a rangefinder camera is that it
            calculates distance through triangulation for accurate focusing. It
            uses a somewhat similar mechanism as the SLR, except that this
            mechanism, which involves a compact revolving mirror and two
            windows, is used for focusing—not for viewing the scene to be
            captured. Also, unlike the SLR, a rangefinder does not allow you to
            look through the lens, but through a small window on the upper right
            side (in the same way you would with a point-and-shoot camera).

          <h3>Point-and-Shoot Cameras</h3>
          <p>
            Without mirrors or any of the other complex mechanisms found in more
            sophisticated cameras, point-and-shoots are generally very compact
            and lightweight. These are what people call “disposable” or
            one-time-use cameras, as they cannot be reloaded with a new roll of
            film. As the name suggests, point-and-shoot cameras don’t allow you
            to do anything other than point and shoot. The camera controls focus
            and exposure settings automatically, plus it has a fixed focal
            length lens so you won’t be able to zoom in or out.
