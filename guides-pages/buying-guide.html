      <p>
        There’s bags of stuff on eBay, and that’s probably the first place to
        start. A 35mm single-lens reflex (SLR) camera would be your best bet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opt for a model from one of the big five brands from back in the
        seventies: Canon, Minolta, Nikon, Olympus or Pentax. They’re all basic,
        hardwearing, top quality and shouldn’t come at too much cost. 35mm film
        cassettes can also be bought cheaply on Amazon.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can pick a classic, pre-owned Canon A1 up for around £80, or an AE-1
        Program for slightly more, and they can do everything. But any camera
        with a program mode is good for a beginner. Program is an exposure
        function that does all the hard work for you, until you feel ready to
        manually alter your shots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Famed for bridging the gap between photographers and hobbyists in the
        seventies, both Canon cameras come fitted with ‘shutter priority’, which
        means you can choose your shutter speed, and your camera will
        automatically choose an aperture. Other great options include the
        (almost) indestructible Pentax K1000 and the Olympus OM-1.
      </p>

        If you want to get your hands on the camera before you buy, then check
        out vintage markets – but without the safety net of eBay or Amazon, you
        have to know what to look out for. As you pick them up, go through all
        the shutter speeds and make sure they're not sticking - that is, opening
        but not closing. That's your first port of call.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also worth checking if replacement batteries are still available
        for your chosen camera. Mercury sales were deemed a bit dangerous in the
        late eighties, so many batteries have been discontinued. Give it a
        Google before you buy, just in case.
      </p>

        So now that you have a better idea of what film photography is, how the
        different cameras work, all the different types of film formats and
        cameras, you can go to our cameras page to find the best camera for you.
