      <p>
        When it comes to choosing a film camera, it’s important to remember that
        different cameras shoot different kinds of film. Basically, a film’s
        format is the size of the film. The most popular formats, and also the
        most widely available, are 35mm, medium format and large format. Some
        other, lesser-used formats such as 127, 110 and APS, are available, but
        they aren’t as easy to get hold of.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference in size between the formats has a big impact on the final
        image you will get. The smaller the format the more visible grain there
        is. These films also tend to have more variety. Large format film will
        give you more detail and very little grain, but your options are more
        limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering what film format is best for you is a vital step when it
        comes to picking the right camera. This is because a camera will only
        work with one type of film. Our guide to film formats will help give you
        an idea of why you would pick one format over another.

          <h3>35mm Film</h3>
          <p>
            Is the most common film format, which can be processed in your local
            photo lab, drugstore or supermarket. 35mm film comes in canisters
            and is characterized by its sprocket holes – little perforations
            which run along the edge of the film strip.

          <h3>Medium Format Film</h3>
          <p>
            Medium format is also known as 120 film. It is 6 cm wide and
            different cameras shoot different variations of frame length. The
            area of the image is much bigger than 35mm, giving you more detail
            and much less grain.

          <h3>Large Format Film</h3>
          <p>
            Large format film is the oldest format still available. This film
            comes in sheets instead of rolls. Which is why it is often referred
            to as sheet film. The most popular sizes are 4×5 and 8×10. Your
            camera size will determine the size of film you need. When you shoot
            large format film you work at a much slower pace. This is partly to
            do with the cost of the film, as you have to make every shot count.
            And also partly to do with how the cameras function. Setting up and
            focussing a large format camera is a more involved process requiring
            more time and effort. Because of the size of the image the level of
            grain is much smaller.

          <h3>Instant</h3>
          <p>
            Instant photos do not require photo lab processing; they magically
            develop within a few seconds. It’s a great choice for spontaneous
            moments; once you click the shutter, the camera ejects the photo
            which develops in less than a minute.

            Color Negative film produces natural, true-to-life colors and smooth
            grain. They go through standard processing using C-41 chemicals.

            Redscale film yields warm hues, ranging from radiant reds to honey
            hues. You can either do the redscale technique yourself (using a
            Color Negative film) or get one that is ready-to-shoot.
