          Before we get started, here are some words that are good to know in
          order to understand how film photography and cameras work.
        </p>
        <h2>Analogue photoglossary</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><b>135</b> – Also called 35mm; the most common film format.</li>
          <li>
            <b>120</b> – A type of paper-backed film used in various medium
            format cameras like the Diana+ and Lubitel 166+.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Analogue</b> – is the opposite of digital. Any technology, such
            as vinyl records or clocks with hands and faces, that doesn't break
            everything down into binary code to work is analogue. Analogue, you
            might say, is strictly old school.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Aperture</b> – A hole or opening through which light travels. On
            a camera, the aperture is adjustable so you can control the amount
            of light reaching the film.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Auto Exposure</b> – Found in a number of modern cameras, this is
            an exposure system that exposes the film correctly every time,
            without the adjustment of manual settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Darkroom</b> – Literally, a dark room in which you can chemically
            process film or print from negatives without exposing the
            photo-sensitive film and paper to light.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Double Exposure</b> – A technique in which a piece of film is
            exposed twice. Double exposures can result in a dreamy, layered
            effect, or an upside-down, mish-mash world of your choosing!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Exposure</b> – The amount of light which reaches your film when
            taking a photograph.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Exposure Time</b> – The amount of time your shutter is open and
            your film is exposed to light. If you choose to expose your film for
            a long amount of time, your aperture will need to be smaller, and
            vice versa.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Film</b> – A sheet of plastic coated with a photo-sensitive
            emulsion. When used in a camera, the emulsion captures light which
            creates latent images, viewable when the film is chemically treated.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Focus</b> – Bringing a subject into sharp view using a camera’s
            lens.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Grain</b> – The sand-like, granular appearance of silver halides
            on film. High ISO films have larger (and therefore more visible)
            grain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Instant Film</b> – Film which develops into a photographic print
            instantly, usually in 90 seconds or less.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>ISO</b> – the term that we use when we are referring to how
            light-sensitive your film is. Each type of film has an ISO rating.
            Can also be referred to as <b>ASA</b>, <b>film rating</b> or
            <b>film speed</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Lens</b> – A glass or plastic element attached to a camera which
            allows images to be captured on film.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Light Leaks</b> – White or red streaks on film created by stray
            light that enters a camera body. While originally accidental,
            creating light leaks on images is now a well-known technique used by
            plastic camera photographers.

          <li>
            <b>Long exposure</b> – This is an effect achieved by setting a
            long-duration shutter speed so that stationary objects in the field
            of view appear sharp while moving elements will be blurred.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Overexposure</b> – When too much light reaches the film, causing
            a printed image to lack detail or look too light or “washed out” or
            “blown out.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Point and Shoot</b> – A camera with fully automatic settings,
            allowing the user to create photographs without setting a shutter
            speed or aperture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Shutter speed</b> – How long your camera’s shutter stays open;
            usually measured in fractions of a second. You can adjust your
            camera’s shutter speed via a dial on the camera body in order to
            achieve light-streaked photos, correctly expose a scene, or sharply
            capture a fast-moving object.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Underexposure</b> – When insufficient light reaches the film.
            Underexposing is also a technique employed when exposing one frame
            of film multiple times, in order to prevent overexposure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Viewfinder</b> – the eyepiece on a camera that you hold close to
            your eye, to allow you to see what’s being photographed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Vignetting</b> – Dark corners present on photographic prints
            which emphasize the photo’s subject and create depth in a
            photograph.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The term ‘Analogue Photography’ refers to photography using an
          analogue camera and film. A roll of film is loaded into the camera and
          the magic begins once you start clicking: light interacts with the
          chemicals in the film and an image is recorded. The pictures collected
          in your film roll come to life when the film is processed in a photo
          lab.
