      <p>
        Film photography has been a big passion of many for many years. Since it
        was created in the 1800s, its uniqueness, imperfections, latitude and
        richness has photographers young and old continuing to fall in love with
        analogue photography. Although it is harder nowadays to get a film
        camera in your hands since many companies stopped manufacturing them,
        recently there's been a resurgence of film photographers of different
        ages and backgrounds. The interest is there and that's all the spark you
        need to get things going.
      </p>

        However, getting started on film photography can be a hard and tedious
        process; many new things to learn, techniques, words you don’t
        understand… But no need to worry! We have created a number of guides
        that can be helpful for any, beginners or experts, who want to indulge
        into the wonderful world of film photography.
